This year, my core contributions focused on streamlining data processes, optimizing resources, and applying my technical skills to improve overall data tasks and efficiency.

Learning & Application: In the initial phase, I built a strong foundation in Azure fundamentals and cloud concepts, enhanced my knowledge of tools like ADF and Databricks, and refined my skills in Python and SQL.

Data Process Optimization: I developed pipelines in ADF and Databricks using Python and PySpark to load/unload data in D365, handling data cleaning and transformations as required.

Key contributions included delivering data to downstream applications like ADW with appropriate formatting and transformations.

Added features like automated data delivery with email attachments, which enabled efficient compliance notes sharing with business stakeholders.


Business Continuity (BCM): Contributed to Disaster Recovery setup in East US2 as part of BCM, ensuring production resilience.

Tech Debt Reduction: Implemented a purge pipeline for storage optimization and used scripts to streamline deployment processes, effectively reducing tech debt and resource usage.

UBS Hackathon: Participated in the UBS Hackathon, where I primarily handled backend development for a client sentiment analysis project. This involved exploring machine learning algorithms, problem-solving, and cross-team collaboration. My research on PowerBI for reporting led to an opportunity to present our concept to the business team.

Testing & QA Support: Assisted the QA team by providing SQL queries for data validation and testing support, which contributed to more robust data integrity checks.


Development areas:

I aim to further develop my communication skills, increasing my vocal participation in team discussions and collaboration on key topics. While I have built strong technical proficiency, I recognize the need to be more proactive in sharing ideas and feedback, which will enable me to contribute more dynamically within the team. Additionally, engaging in various team activities will help me make a broader impact.


UBS Behaviors:

Demonstrated Accountability with Integrity by swiftly adapting to new tools and applying them in client-focused solutions, ensuring quality and alignment with UBS standards.

Showcased Collaboration by actively supporting teammates, sharing insights, and fostering a collaborative work environment.

Embraced Innovation through the UBS hackathon, exploring machine learning and reporting tools for enhanced client sentiment analysis.
