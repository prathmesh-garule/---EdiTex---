C library function - perror()
The C library function void perror(const char *str) prints a descriptive error message to stderr. First the string str is printed, followed by a colon then a space.


What is O_rdwr?
Open for writing only. O_RDWR. Open for reading and writing. The result is undefined if this flag is applied to a FIFO.


// File Descrepter=fd
//this is method to save the buffer 

// matlab fd is will geive adress of open file
//lseek = will return offset adress otherwise -1;


getmaxy returns the maximum (screen-relative) y value for the current graphics driver and mode.





memmove() is used to copy a block of memory from a location to another. It is declared in string.h

// Copies "numBytes" bytes from address "from" to address "to"
void * memmove(void *to, const void *from, size_t numBytes);



The clrtoeol() and wclrtoeol() functions erase the current line from the cursor to the end of the line, inclusive, in the current or specified window. These functions do not update the cursor.




 The move() and wmove() functions move the cursor associated with the current or specified window to (y, x) relative to the window's origin. This function does not move the terminal's cursor until the next refresh operation.



The curs_set() function sets the appearance of the cursor based on the value of visibility:
Value of visibility	Appearance of Cursor
0	Invisible
1	Terminal-specific normal mode
2	Terminal-specific high visibility mode


This function takes two strings s1 and s2 as an argument and finds the first occurrence of the sub-string s2 in the string s1. The process of matching does not include the terminating null-characters(‘\0’), but function stops there.



What is ifdef and endif?
ifdef means "if the following is defined" while ifndef means "if the following is not defined". So: #define one 0 #ifdef one printf("one is defined "); #endif #ifndef one printf("one is not defined "); #endif. is equivalent to: printf("one is defined "); since one is defined so the ifdef is true and the ifndef is false ...


lssek = it return offset adress , (i am using to check Wheather it Saved or Not)



The curses clear() function doesn't just clear the screen; it clears the curses internal representation of the state of your screen. Your actual screen won't be cleared until you call refresh() . If you just want to clear the screen immediately, you should find another way to do it


The clrtoeol() and wclrtoeol() routines erase the current line to the right of the cursor, inclusive, to the end of the current line.
